# 💧 Week 1 – Water Quality Prediction Using AI

### 🌿 Theme: Sustainability (Environmental Protection & Clean Water)

**Objective:**  
To develop an AI model that predicts whether water is safe or unsafe for drinking based on various chemical and physical properties.

---

## 📅 Week 1 Tasks

### 🔹 1. Problem Definition
The goal of this project is to predict the **potability of water** (safe = 1, unsafe = 0) using machine learning techniques.  
This supports sustainability by promoting clean and safe water consumption practices.

### 🔹 2. Dataset Collection
- **Dataset Name:** Water Potability Dataset  
- **Source (Kaggle):** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability)  
- **Attributes:**  
  `pH`, `Hardness`, `Solids`, `Chloramines`, `Sulfate`, `Conductivity`, `Organic_carbon`, `Trihalomethanes`, `Turbidity`, `Potability`

### 🔹 3. Data Preprocessing
- Loaded dataset using `pandas`
- Checked for missing and duplicate values  
- Filled missing values with the column mean  
- Removed duplicates if any  
- Verified datatypes and basic statistics  

### 🔹 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized data distributions using **histograms and boxplots**  
- Checked feature correlations using **heatmaps**  
- Observed how each parameter affects water potability  

### 🔹 5. Week 1 Deliverables
- ✅ Problem statement and objective defined  
- ✅ Dataset collected from Kaggle  
- ✅ Data cleaned and preprocessed  
- ✅ EDA completed with visualizations  
- ✅ Insights noted for next week (Model Building)

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

---

## 📘 Insights from Week 1
- pH, sulfate, and solids levels strongly affect whether water is potable.  
- Visual analysis shows that safe water samples generally maintain balanced chemical levels.

## 🧩 Next Week (Preview)
In Week 2, the focus will be on **Model Selection & Building** — training machine learning models to predict water potability and comparing their accuracy.
