# 💧 Week 2 – Water Quality Prediction Using AI
### 🌿 Theme: Sustainability (Clean Water)

**Objective:**  
To train and evaluate machine learning models that can predict whether water is potable (safe for drinking) or not, using the cleaned dataset from Week 1.

---

## 📘 Tasks Completed

### 🔹 Data Preparation
- Imported the cleaned dataset (`cleaned_water_data.csv`).
- Split the dataset into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** sets.

### 🔹 Model Selection & Training
Trained the following models:
1. Logistic Regression  
2. Decision Tree Classifier  
3. Random Forest Classifier  
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### 🔹 Model Evaluation
- Calculated model accuracies using `accuracy_score`.  
- Compared models and selected the best performer.  
- Evaluated results using confusion matrix and classification report.  

### 🔹 Observations
- Random Forest Classifier gave the **highest accuracy**.  
- pH, Solids, and Sulfate levels strongly influence water quality.  
- The dataset is now ready for model optimization in Week 3.
